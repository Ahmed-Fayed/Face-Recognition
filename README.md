# Face Recognition

Using Keras-FaceNet pre-trained Model

Detecting (localizing) faces using (MTCNN Algorithm)

Recognizing faces using Embeddings of Siamese Network Architecture

Calculating Ecludian Space between two vectors (representing two persons) to determin if they are same person

if the two vectors are close from each other (distance is small), meaning that they are likely to be the same person
